    "## Potential Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: Does attending class in person cause a person to get an A grade (vs getting a grade lower than an A)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a causal question, because we are interested in knowing if the treatment, attending class in person, has an effect on the grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that some people attend class in person and some log in remotely. We also know what grade each person receives. Suppose that 70\\% of people who attend class in person get an A but 30\\% of people who attend remotely get an A. We can't say that going to class in person *causes* a higher grade. The reason is that people who go to class in-person may have other characteristics that cause them to get an A. For example, they could be more motivated or they may have more preparation for the class. The difference in characteristics between those who attend class and those who don't is called *selection bias*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gold standard for causal questions is a randomized clinical trial (RCT), because randomization solves the problem of selection bias.\n",
    "An RCT ensures that, on average, the treatment is independent of the potential outcome.\n",
    "But what is a potential outcome?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that *if* I receive treatment $A$, then I *will* get outcome $Y(A)$.\n",
    "Instead, suppose that *if* I receive treatment $B$, then I *will* get outcome $Y(B)$.\n",
    "My potential outcomes, therefore, are $Y(A)$ and $Y(B)$. Note, these outcome exist in theory. Which outcome I observe depends on which treatment I got in reality. The outcome that I *actually* observe depends on the treatment I receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we can only observe one outcome, and so we can only observe one potential outcome.\n",
    "This is the *fundamental problem of causal inference*.\n",
    "Because of this, causal inference is a missing data problem.\n",
    "An RCT provides a principled way to perform this imputation, but often we only have observational data.\n",
    "In this case, the potential outcome framework is necessary because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. causal inference is subtle\n",
    "2. it ensures we are working with a causal question\n",
    "3. it helps us identify the causal claim\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "For now, suppose that there are only two treatments.\n",
    "We write that\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "Y_i(1) &\\text{ is the potential outcome for person } i \\text{ under treatment} \\\\\n",
    "Y_i(0) &\\text{ is the potential outcome for person } i \\text{ under no treatment}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $i$ could also refer to a \\textit{unit} when we are not working with people or patients.\n",
    "In our example above, attending class in-person refers to treatment $(1)$, whereas not attending class in-person corresponds to no treatment $(0)$.\n",
    "This notation will allow us to mathematically formulate our assumptions, as well identify our causal question and perform our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to our original question, suppose we know the potential outcomes of six people:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Table 1\n",
    "\n",
    "| Person | $Y_i(1)$ | $Y_i(0)$ | $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$|\n",
    "|:------:|:--------:|:--------:|:----------------:|\n",
    "|    1   |     1    |     1    |       0          |\n",

    "|    6   |     0    |     0    |       0          |\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Y_i(1) = 1$ is getting an A if person $i$ attends in-person and $Y_i(1) = 0$ is getting less than an A if person $i$ attends in-person.\n",
    "Similarly, $Y_i(0) = 1$ is getting an A if person $i$ does not attend and $Y_i(0) = 0$ is getting less than an A if person $i$ does not attend.\n",
    "Given the above, $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$ is the effect of attending class in person on the grade of person $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we can see what the effect would be for each person.\n",
    "In particular, persons 1 and 2 will get an A no matter their treatment; person 3 will be helped by treatment, i.e will get an A if they attend and will not get an A if they don't attend. Persons 4 and 6 will always get less than an A no matter their treatment; person 5 will be hurt by treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, we will never see both potential outcomes for each person.\n",
    "Instead, we will observe something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Table 2\n",
    "\n",
    "| Person | $A_i$ | $Y_i$ |\n",
    "|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A_i$ is the treatment for person $i$ and $Y_i$ is the observed outcome for person $i$. \n",
    "Thus, persons 1, 2, and 3 attend class in-person, whereas persons 4, 5, and 6 do not.\n",
    "And persons 1, 2, 3, and 5 get an A, whereas persons 4 and 6 do not.\n",
    "Using this observed data, we can partially fill out our potential outcomes table:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Table 3\n",

    "The goal of causal inference is to fill in these missing values so that we can understand the effect of attending class on grades.\n",
    "In the case of an RCT, we can estimate $Y_i(1)$ just through the outcomes of those treated, because randomization ensures the outcome is independent of the treatment.\n",
    "Likewise for estimating $Y_i(0)$.\n",
    "For observational studies, we will attempt to emulate a RCT, which will require us to make more assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because of the fundamental problem of causal inference, we will never be able to know the treatment effects on an individual level.\n",
    "That is, unlike Table 1, where we know the treatment effects for each person, Table 3 will only ever allow us to estimate average treatment effects."

    "## Average Treatment Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already established that we cannot know an individual's treatment effect. The reason is that we can't observe their outcome both when they do and do not get treated.[^1] What we can try to learn, however, is the average treatment effect in the sample of people we're considering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we know the average potential outcome in the treated group and the average potential outcome in the control group. The difference in the average potential outcomes is the average treatment effect. Organizations often care about the average treatment effect. Let's say we are a political campaign and that we want to raise money. We have a choice of whether to send email A or email B. To determine which email to send, we need to know whether we raise more money when we send email A or B. In this case, we care about getting the highest average treatment effect. Note that it could be the case that for some individuals A causes more donations than B (and vice versa). However, the campaign cares about the sum of the donations.[^2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we can't know the potential outcomes, we only know the realized outcomes. One thing we can do is compare realized outcomes for those who get email A with those who get email B. Typically, we'd be worried about selection bias. However, if we randomized who got email A and B, we can compare the difference in average realized outcomes to get an estimate of the average treatment effect. What do we mean by an estimate, think of it as the best guess, given the available data, that we have about the average treatment effect. An estimator is a procedure for getting the estimate. In this case, the estimator consists of taking the average donations of all those who got email A and subtracting the average donations of all those who got email B.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now describe the above in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: You may wonder, can't a person get treated one day and not treated the next? This is a great question. We have to be very precise with what we mean by a potential outcome. We can't guarantee that a person's potential outcomes one day are the same as their potential outcomes the next. For example, suppose that you had a lot of sleep one day but not a lot of sleep the next. On the day when you had little sleep, going to lecture in-person may not have mattered as much as on a day with a lot of sleep. Therefore, the potential outcome is always defined with respect to the specific time at which a person gets treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^2]: This would be different if the campaign could target emails to different users. We will discuss this example later."

    "*Expectation* is the weighted average of all possible outcomes, where the weights are the probabilities with which the event happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we roll a die and $X$ is a random variable describing the value of the roll.\n",
    "For a fair die, we have $f_X(x) = 1/6$ for all $x \\in \\Omega = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 6\\}$. That is, each of the 6 values is equally likely.\n",
    "Then the expected value for $X$ is\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[X] &= \\sum_{x=1}^6 x \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(X = x) \\\\\n",
    "&= 1 \\cdot 1/6 + 2 \\cdot 1/6 + \\cdots + 6 \\cdot 1/6 \\\\\n",
    "&= 3.5\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the expectation of $X$ is $3.5$.\n",
    "It should be clear that even though this is the expected value of our die, it is not possible to actually obtain $3.5$.\n",
    "So, while the expectation describes the \"typical\" outcome, it need not be observable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few properties of expectation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[a] &= a & \\text{expectation of a constant} \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important concept is conditional expectation.\n",
    "The *conditional expectation* of a random variable (RV) is its expectation given certain constraints (conditions) on the random variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[X | X \\text{ is even}] &= 2\\cdot \\mathbb{P}(X = 2 | X \\text{ is even}) + 4\\cdot \\mathbb{P}(X = 4 | X \\text{ is even}) + 6\\cdot \\mathbb{P}(X = 6 | X \\text{ is even}) \\\\\n",
    "&= 2\\cdot 1/3 + 4\\cdot 1/3 + 6\\cdot 1/3 \\\\\n",
    "&= 4\n",

    "### ATE and ATT\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that by the fundamental problem of causal inference, we will never be able to infer individual treatment effects.\n",

    "$$ATE = \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(0)]$$\n",
    "In words, the ATE is the difference between the expected outcomes under treatment versus no treatment.\n",
    "In the case of randomized treatment, we can estimate the ATE as the difference in empirical means of the treated versus untreated, since randomization ensures the treatment is independent of the potential outcome. Here is the formal math. Let $T_{i}$ be the random variable that represents whether individual, i, is treated. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) | T_{i} = 1] &= \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)] = \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) | T_{i} = 0] \\\\\n",

    "Hence, in a randomized setting, we have\n",
    "$$ATE = \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) | T_i = 1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(0) | T_i = 0]$$\n",
    "We can estimate ATE using our standard estimator for means:\n",
    "$$\\widehat{ATE} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i \\cdot 1_{T_i = 1} - \\frac{1}{N-m}\\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i \\cdot 1_{T_i = 0}$$\n",

    "This estimator has the desirable property that it is unbiased.\n",
    "For this to even make sense, we have to recognize that the estimator is a random variable, since the estimator is a function of the data, which is itself random.\n",
    "Then, the estimator is unbiased if its expectation is equal to the parameter it is estimating.\n",
    "In this case, that means $\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{ATE}] = ATE$.\n",

    "## Forms of Randomization:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several commonly used forms of randomization. The first one is called ''simple'' randomization. For this randomization, the assignment of a unit to the treatment and control is determined independently. For example, if one wants to treat 50% of the sample, one can flip a coin and if it is heads then the treatment is assigned. This form of randomization but does not exactly achieve the desired treatment probabilities. Just by chance, more or less than 50% of people may be assigned to the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next form of randomization is ''complete'' randomization. Under complete randomization, one has a target number of treated units and exactly those units are randomized to treatment. This can be done, for example, by assigning each unit a random normal draw, and giving the treatment to the top N units based on the random draw. Complete randomization is especially useful when you have a limited number of treatments to assign due to a budget constraint, or when the sample size is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of randomization is called blocking. Using the above two forms of randomization, one can by chance have imbalanace in covariates between treatment and control. For example, the treatment may have more men then women. Blocking eliminates this risk by completely randomizing within subgroups of the population. For example, if one wants to assign 10 out of 20 units to treatment. Then blocking would randomly select 5 men and randomly select 5 women to treatment. This would be called blocking on gender. Generally, the best variables to block on are ones that predict the outcome and for which imbalance could be a substantial problem. Blocking is an attempt to control this unwanted variability, which increases precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another form of randomization is *cluster randomization*, whereby treatment is assigned at a group level.\n",
    "For example, if treatment is a different teaching style, then necessarily entire classes are given the treatment at the same time.\n",
    "Likewise for ad campaigns or product pricing.\n",
    "Clustered random designs introduce dependency between the individuals within a cluster, which violates our independence assumption.\n",
    "This needs to be taken into account in a regression, and generally results in lower power."

    "## Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is a foundational method in statistics that relates to many other topics.\n",
    "In particular, linear regression, which we focus on here, is often taught as its own course.\n",
    "For this reason, we provide only a brief overview, but there are many excellent resources that explore the depth of this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a model that assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.\n",
    "We say that\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "Y &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_pX_p + \\varepsilon \\\\\n",
    "&= \\beta_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^p \\beta_pX_p + \\varepsilon \\\\\n",
    "&= X\\beta + \\varepsilon\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where $Y$ is the dependent variable or *response*, $X_1, \\ldots, X_p$ are the independent or explanatory or predictor variables or *covariates*, $\\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p$ are the corresponding (regression) *coefficients*, $\\beta_0$ is the *intercept* term, and $\\varepsilon$ is the *noise*.\n",
    "The noise, $\\varepsilon$, is taken to be mean zero, and represents the deviations from perfect linearity, which could be an artifact of imprecise measurements, or more likely that the \"true\" relationship is being approximated linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data $(X_1, Y_1), \\ldots, (X_n, Y_n)$, our goal is to estimate the coefficients.\n",
    "To do this, we use the method of ordinary least squares:\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS} = \\underset{\\tilde{\\beta}}{\\arg\\min} \\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i)^2$$\n",
    "where $\\hat{Y}_i = \\tilde{\\beta}_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\tilde{\\beta}_i$.\n",
    "This can be solved using calculus yielding the following closed-form solution:\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^TY$$\n",
    "Under certain distributional assumptions, this solution is the same as the maximum likelihood estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear regression, we make several assumptions but the following ones are most relevant for this class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The response is a linear combination of the covariates and their regression coefficients.\n",
    "2. There is no multicollinearity between the predictors.\n",
    "3. If we want a causal interpretation of a coefficient on a variable x, the variable x should be independent of the error term. This would be violated in the case of selection bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions should be checked via diagnostic tools whenever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main uses of linear regression.\n",
    "The first major use is inference.\n",
    "Regression is very interpretable, so we can easily understand the relationships between the dependent and independent variables.\n",
    "Moreover, we can use the regression setting to test if linear relationships exist (are they significant?) and if so, what are their effects (what is the magnitude of the estimated coefficient?). If we make the assumption of errors being independent of the covariaties, then we can interpret the coefficients in the regression as being causal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second major use is prediction.\n",
    "We can use the regression coefficients to predict what the response would be given a certain set of covariates.\n",
    "Next, we will discuss use cases specific to causal inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Log Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Critically, linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the response and the parameters.\n",
    "But what if we plot the data and the relationship is more complex?\n",
    "In some cases, we can use data transformations to recover linearity.\n",
    "One of the most popular such transformations is the logarithm.\n",
    "This is appropriate when the measurement of the response is on a logarithmic scale, which is multiplicative, rather than a linear scale.\n",
    "For example, the magnitude of earthquakes is measured with the Richter scale, which is logarithmic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to transforming the response variable, it is also common to transform the covariates.\n",
    "(Ask yourself why this does not violate the linearity assumption.)\n",
    "Combinations of transformations of dependent and independent variables yield the following models:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "Y &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\varepsilon \\tag{$M_1$} \\\\\n",
    "\\log Y &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X  + \\varepsilon \\tag{$M_2$} \\\\\n",
    "Y &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log X + \\varepsilon \\tag{$M_3$} \\\\\n",
    "\\log Y &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log X + \\varepsilon \\tag{$M_4$}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "These models have the following different coefficient interpretations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $(M_1)$ We expect a $\\beta_1$ increase in $Y$ for every unit increase in $X$\n",
    "- $(M_2)$ A unit increase in $X$ is expected to change $\\log Y$ by $\\beta_1$ or, equivalently, change $Y$ by $e^{\\beta_1}$ for natural log. An approximation is that a z unit change in X changes Y by $\\beta_{1} * z * 100$\\%.\n",
    "- $(M_3)$ $Y$ is expected to change by $\\beta_1 \\times \\frac{k}{100}$ for every $k$\\% increase in $X$.\n",
    "- $(M_4)$ On average, a k\\% change in X results in a $k \\times \\beta_{1}$\\% change in Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "We might wonder or expect that there is an *interactive* effect between two variables.\n",
    "For example, suppose we have two binary covariates $x_1$ and $x_2$.\n",
    "We could use the following model with an interaction $x_1x_2$:\n",
    "$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\beta_3x_1x_2 + \\varepsilon$$\n",
    "In this case, it is easy to interpret the coefficients simply by checking the combinations of $x_1$ and $x_2$:\n",
    "$$y = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\beta_0 + \\varepsilon & \\text{ if } x_1 = x_2 = 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\varepsilon & \\text{ if } x_1 = 1 \\text{ and } x_2 = 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\beta_0 + \\beta_2 + \\varepsilon & \\text{ if } x_1 = 0 \\text{ and } x_2 = 1 \\\\\n",
    "\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_3 + \\varepsilon & \\text{ if } x_1 = x_2 = 1\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "Note that this is a saturated model, since there are as many parameters as variables, i.e\n",
    "$$\\widehat{\\beta_0} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^n I(x_{i1} = x_{i2} = 0)}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\cdot I(x_{i1} = x_{i2} = 0)$$\n",
    "where $I(x_{i1} = x_{i2} = 0)$ is the indicator that subject $i$ has $x_1 = x_2 = 0$. If all of the variables are binary, then the predicted value of is just the mean of y (the outcome) for that combination of variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "In `Python`, we use the module [`PyFixest`](https://s3alfisc.github.io/pyfixest/tutorial/) and especially `pyfixest.estimation.feols`, in which an interaction can be included using the formula `y ~ x1 + x2 + x1:x2`.\n",
    "Equivalently, you can use `y ~ x1 * x2`, which automatically includes the main effect terms. Alternatively, one can also use `statsmodels.api.OLS.from_formula`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications to Causal Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we can do with regression is estimate the ATE.\n",
    "If we just want to see the relationship of the treatment on the outcome, then using regression will produce the same estimates as taking the difference of means.\n",
    "However, regression has the advantage of being able to incorporate any controls, which is necessary for observational studies, but also useful for randomized trials if the covariates are imbalanced by chance and small sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along those lines, we can also use regression to perform randomization tests (alternatively called balance checks).\n",
    "It is impossible for the treatment to affect anything before the experiment, and we can use this temporal argument to test whether the experiment was implemented properly.\n",
    "For example, the treatment should not affect demographics such as sex, race, or gender.\n",
    "If we run regress one of these *fixed* values on the treatment and find the regression coefficient for the treatment is significant, then there may be a problem.\n",
    "The most likely explanation is that the covariates are imbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an experiment, if the sample is large enough, then the covariates should be balanced between treatment and control so that the only difference in outcome is due to the treatment.\n",
    "This is the crux of randomization. However, we may have sampling constraints or want to ensure that certain covariates are balanced, which could lead us to sampling schemes other than simple random sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we present sample `Python` code for running a regression, performing diagnostics, and interpreting the output.\n",
    "First, we consider the linear relationship $Y = \\beta_0 + X\\beta_1 + \\varepsilon$, where $\\beta_0 = 3, \\ \\beta_1 = 2$, and $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 100)$.\n",
    "The module [`Seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) has a convinient plotting function `lmplot` for linear models."

    "One simple approach to dealing with non-compliance is to measure the same quantity as ATE, but recognize that it is actually the *intent-to-treat effect* (ITT).\n",
    "The ITT is therefore the average effect of being placed in the treatment group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to know the direct effect of the treatment, then obviously we would like to estimate ATE rather than ITT.\n",
    "However, it is important to recognize that sometimes we are actually interested in ITT.\n",
    "For example, if we want to understand the impact of a policy change such as free access to SAT preparatory classes, then ITT is more relevant than ATE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complier Average Causal Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of ITT, we can also calculate the *complier average causal effect* (CACE).\n",
    "The CACE is the average treatment effect among the compliers.\n",
    "If $T = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1)], \\ C = \\mathbb{E}[Y(0)]$, and $\\alpha$ is the *compliance rate*, then, assuming no effect on non-compliers, we can compute CACE as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "T - C &= \\alpha\\big(T_\\text{compliers} - C_\\text{compliers}\\big) + (1-\\alpha)\\big(T_\\text{non-compliers} - C_\\text{non-compliers}\\big) \\\\\n",
    "&= \\alpha\\big(T_\\text{compliers} - C_\\text{compliers}\\big)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where $T_\\text{non-compliers} = C_\\text{non-compliers}$ is a consequence of our assumption of no effect on non-compliers.\n",
    "Note that $T - C$ is just the ITT, or ATE if $\\alpha = 1$.\n",
    "Thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "\\text{CACE} &= \\big(T_\\text{compliers} - C_\\text{compliers}\\big) \\\\\n",
    "& = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}(T - C) \\\\\n",
    "& = \\frac{ITT}{\\alpha}\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "One observation from the CACE formula is that\n",
    "$$\\text{SE}(CACE) = \\frac{\\text{SE}(ITT)}{\\alpha}$$\n",
    "Since $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$, we will need a much larger sample size for estimating CACE.\n",
    "For example, if the compliance rate is $10\\%$, then the standard errors are 10 times larger and we would need 100 times the sample size to reduce the standard errors accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical note: the standard error computed above is not exactly correct.\n",
    "If we want the correct standard error, we should use the `feols` function in `PyFixest` or conduct randomization inference.\n",
    "You do not have to know how to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the above number as a CACE requires assumptions.\n",
    "The first of these assumptions is that not receiving the treatment does not have an effect.\n",
    "This would be violated in the following scenario.\n",
    "Suppose people assigned to the treatment group expected to get the treatment but did not.\n",
    "The assumption would be violated if this caused the people to become upset and to change their behavior as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important assumption is that the treatment increases the probability of receiving the treatment for everyone.\n",
    "This is by design in the voting example, but may be violated in other circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can avoid computing CACE by identifying the compliers, which can be done via *placebos*.\n",
    "A *placebo treatment* allows us to measure who would have complied.\n",
    "For example, in the example of calling people to increase voter turnout, the placebo is a public service announcement.\n",
    "The group that answers the phone call in the 'placebo' group would have been the compliers in the treatment group.\n",
    "Therefore, we can directly compare the compliers in the placebo group and the compliers in the treatment group to compute the CACE.\n",
    "This will give us more precise estimates when the compliance rate is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are no free lunches and use of a placebo is both expensive and subject to further assumptions.\n",
    "A key assumption is that the placebo treatment has no effect on the outcome.\n",
    "A second key assumption is that the likelihood of compliance is the same in the treatment and placebo groups.\n",
    "This assumption can be tested by looking at the realized compliance rates."

    "## Observational Data\n",

    "Here, we discuss the difference-in-difference method for performing causal inference with observational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference in Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1850s, a London doctor named John Snow went door to door to observe the presence of cholera.\n",
    "Additionally, he tabulated the water supply source for each household.\n",
    "His assumption was that \"there is no difference whatever in the houses or the people receiving the supply of the two Water Companies, or in any of the physical conditions with which they are surrounded.\"\n",
    "Therefore, Snow was able to compare cholera status in two groups that were similar except for their treatment.\n",
    "In doing so, he was able to determine a causal link between water source and cholera being the first to establish cholera as a water-borne disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial step in this analysis is that if two groups are similar except for treatment, then any differences in outcomes between the groups is due to the treatment.\n",
    "This methodology is known as *difference in differences* (DID).\n",
    "If $Y_{it}$ is our response for group $i$ at time $t$, then the difference in differences is calculated as\n",
    "$$DID = \\left(Y_{1, \\ \\text{post}} - Y_{0, \\ \\text{post}}\\right) - \\left(Y_{1, \\ \\text{pre}} - Y_{0, \\ \\text{pre}}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One important assumption for the difference in differences method is the *assumption of parallel trends*, which says that without treatment, the difference between the treatment and control group is constant over time.\n",
    "This assumption cannot be tested statistically, but it is important to visualize the relationship if observations are available over time.\n",
    "In particular, you want to see that the pre-intervention relationship between treatment and control group is in lockstep, i.e any deviations only occur post-intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use simple algebra to demonstrate why the difference in differences estimator works.\n",
    "Consider the setting of brand keyword advertising in search engines.\n",
    "Suppose that Ebay turns off its ads on Bing but keeps them on Google.\n",
    "Furthermore, suppose that the log of clicks can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "$$E[Y_{it}] = \\gamma_{i} + \\lambda_{t} + \\delta T_{it}$$\n",
    "or in words:\n",
    "$$E[\\text{Log}(\\text{Clicks for Search Engine $i$ in time period $t$})] = \\gamma_{i} + \\lambda_{t} + \\delta T_{it}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there are two periods (before and after), then we can show that the simple difference in differences results in an unbiased estimate of $\\delta$, the treatment effect. \n",
