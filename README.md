## Course materials for BA830: Business Experimentation and Causal Methods

### Course Description
When is making a change to a price, algorithm, or product worthwhile? Rather than relying on the gut intuition of a manager, businesses are increasingly using experiments and other forms of causal data analysis to answer these questions. In this class, we will learn about causal methods, when they work, how to implement them in Python, and how to apply them to topics including pricing, reputation system design, social networks, advertising, and algorithms.
